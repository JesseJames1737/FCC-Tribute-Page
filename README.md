# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to put into practice the HTML and CSS that I have learned through freecodecamp.org's program. I will be using W3 schools, stack overflow, and MDN web docs for support. I will not use any tutorials or other tools that real developers (web designer more or less in this case) would not have access to on a project. 

# Steps

1. Create HTML outline of project, divs etc.
2. Bring the page into focus by placing divs into attractive spots using CSS
3. Style page with CSS
4. Make the page responsive on tablets and phones with CSS
