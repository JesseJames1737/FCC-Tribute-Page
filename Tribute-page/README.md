# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to put into practice the HTML and CSS that I have learned through freecodecamp.org's program. I will be using W3 schools, stack overflow, and MDN web docs for support. I will not use any tutorials or other tools that real developers (web designer more or less in this case) would not have access to on a project. 

# Steps

1. Create HTML outline of project, divs etc.
2. Bring the page into focus by placing divs into attractive spots using CSS
3. Style page with CSS
4. Make the page responsive on tablets and phones with CSS

6/10/2021 8:00am I didn't keep track of all I learned because I learned it all so fast. I got back to this project on June 7th and completed the project on June 9th. Some highlights of what I learned:

- Centering in CSS. There are many ways to do it but some ways better than others. Responsive is always a plus, and I didn't know that images were treated as text in CSS. "text-align" seemed as though it wouldn't work with an img. 

- Margins, padding etc. how elements space out and relate to each other. I don't have a full grasp of this but I have a great introduction now. This will easily become more clear as I practice these aspects of web development on future projects. 

- Using CSS classes. This is obviously very powerful and it helped a lot. I used so many I'm sure there is a way of reducing the number of classes, or at least being more effecient in the work flow.
